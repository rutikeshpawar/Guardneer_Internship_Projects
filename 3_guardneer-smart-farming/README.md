# 🚜 Guardneer Smart Farming & Water Optimization Dashboard

An industry-level data analytics project developed during a 6-month internship at **Guardneer**, focused on improving agricultural efficiency through water optimization and soil health insights using data analytics and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To help Guardneer and farmers:
- Monitor and improve **crop yield**
- Track **soil health** and **irrigation effectiveness**
- Measure **Guardneer device impact** on farm performance

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
Realistic synthetic data was generated to simulate:
- Farms, farmers, crop and soil details
- Daily irrigation usage and rainfall
- Guardneer device uptime and anomalies
- Crop yield and revenue

### 📄 Key Files:
- `yield_soil_farm_with_all_features.csv` — Final enriched dataset with all engineered features
- `Guardneer_Final_Dashboard.twbx` — Tableau dashboard with filters, KPIs, and visual insights
- `dashboard_preview.png` — Screenshot of final dashboard

---

## 🔍 Features Engineered
1. `liters_per_day_per_acre` – Water efficiency metric  
2. `water_risk_index` – Irrigation stress score  
3. `profit_per_acre` – Revenue per acre  
4. `soil_health_index` – Composite soil quality score  
5. `reliability_score` – Guardneer uptime score  
6. `irrigation_need_gap` – Ideal vs actual irrigation  
7. `guardneer_effectiveness_score` – Yield improvement ratio

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard Highlights
- KPI Cards: Yield, Soil Health, Profit, Guardneer usage %
- Crop yield by crop type with Guardneer comparison
- Soil health vs yield scatter analysis
- Zone-wise profit performance
- Top 10 performing farms table

> Dashboard is styled with modern layout, sparklines, dropdown filters, and clean visual storytelling.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** — Data generation & preprocessing  
- **Tableau** — Dashboard creation and interactive storytelling  
- **Excel** — Raw data exploration

---

## 🧠 Business Impact
- Identified high-performing crop-soil-guardneer combinations  
- Revealed water overuse in 28% of farms  
- Showed 20–30% yield boost for Guardneer-enabled farms

---

## 🧪 Next Phase: Machine Learning
> Crop yield prediction model to be added soon!
